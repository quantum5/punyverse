punyverse
=========

Python simulator of a puny universe. (How many words can I stick into one?)

Installation
------------

Currently, only Windows is supported.

To install, run `pip install punyverse`.

Then, run `punyverse` to launch the simulator, or `punyversew` to launch without the console.

### A Note on Textures

If your graphics card doesn't support the massive texture sizes this module comes with, you can shrink them.

To do this, run `punyverse_small_images`.
